 Your Christmas shopping list - now dynamically interactive with a grouping feature! Yay! 

This is mostly finished, but an ideal user flow would include form validation for adding groups/recipients, a warning for deleting recipients/groups, a message for empty groups and maybe the addition of an icon system... etc etc. I'd love to add a price totaling feature as well. This was fun to make and taught me tons about how to work with data on the awesome Firebase platform.

Credit given where credit is due, I was inspired by the todo list found at the below link,  but wanted to expand on its features and design. I also employed the use of a firebaseObject, bound to $scope: http://codepen.io/fabiobiondi/pen/DwKqE

Thanks for looking!!
